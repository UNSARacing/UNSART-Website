After months of intensive work, our design team has successfully completed the initial design phase for our Formula Student race car. This milestone represents countless hours of research, CAD modeling, and engineering analysis.

## Design Challenges

Designing a Formula Student car presents unique challenges:

### Aerodynamics
Achieving optimal downforce while minimizing drag requires careful CFD analysis and wind tunnel testing. Our team has been working closely with simulation software to optimize our aerodynamic package.

### Chassis Design
The chassis must be lightweight yet rigid enough to handle the stresses of racing. We've utilized advanced materials and manufacturing techniques to achieve the best balance.

### Powertrain Integration
Integrating the powertrain components while maintaining weight distribution and accessibility for maintenance has been a key focus of our design process.

## Technical Specifications

While we're still finalizing some details, here's what we can share:

- **Engine:** Single-cylinder, 4-stroke
- **Chassis:** Steel space frame
- **Suspension:** Double wishbone front and rear
- **Weight Target:** Under 200kg

## Next Steps

With the design phase complete, we're now moving into:

1. **Manufacturing** - Beginning fabrication of key components
2. **Testing** - Setting up our testing protocols
3. **Assembly** - Preparing for the build phase

## Acknowledgments

We'd like to thank our sponsors and the University of Sarajevo for their continued support throughout this process.
